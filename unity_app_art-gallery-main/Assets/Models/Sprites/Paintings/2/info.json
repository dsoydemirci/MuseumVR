"description": "\"The Scream\" (Skrik) by Munch is an oil painting on canvas created in 1893. It depicts a man screaming, surrounded by a harrowing landscape and symbolic elements such as hands reaching out towards him. Munch intended to express anguish and human loneliness through this work. It was painted during his Symbolist period and is considered one of the masterpieces of Expressionism. It has become a symbol of modern anxiety in art and has been interpreted in various ways, such as a cry of despair in the face of modern life or a reflection of the solitude of the modern individual. The colors used are dark, reflecting the artist's depressive mood at that time. The scream primarily symbolizes anguish, loneliness, and the inability to find one's place in the world."
