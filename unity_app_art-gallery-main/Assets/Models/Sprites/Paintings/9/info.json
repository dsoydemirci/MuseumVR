"description": "\"The Starry Night\" (De sterrennacht) by Van Gogh is an oil painting on canvas created in 1888. It depicts a nocturnal landscape with a starry sky, trees, and a road. Van Gogh used vibrant colors and expressive brushstrokes to capture the emotion of the scene. It was painted during his time at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, France. This painting is considered one of Van Gogh's masterpieces and a hallmark of Impressionism. It was created in just one night, when Van Gogh was inspired by the stars and the tranquility of the surrounding nature. He used vivid colors to represent the stars and the trees, creating a striking contrast between light and darkness. This work is regarded as one of Van Gogh's most famous pieces and is often seen as a symbol of the artist's struggle to connect with nature."
